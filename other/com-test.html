    <h1>COM-TEST is a hoax</h1>
    <h3>[nyahrdh wrote this]</h3>
    <h3>[yes it writes in third person and uses it/its pronouns you can just deal with that]</h3>
    
    <p>nyahrdh is very pedantic. it really, really does not like Slightly Incorrect Information. that's why, when it stumbled upon a youtuber of considerable size saying spreading misinformation about youtube history, it felt the need to say something. so it is.</p>
    <p>if you haven't heard about this whole thing, here's the claim:</p>
    <p>for most of youtube's history, jawed's Me at the zoo has been considered the first video ever posted to the platform, on april 23rd 2005. however, this is not technically true. about two months before this (february 28), at least 5 videos were posted as a test of youtube's video uploading capabilities by an account called COM-TEST. this was discovered by somebody on reddit in late 2020. a while later, one of the videos (titled com-test 2) was discovered to have been uploaded to vimeo, and was then posted back on to youtube.</p>
    
    <p>this information was 'uncovered' by youtuber TheTekkitRealm (hereafter ttr) who made two videos about the subject, the first one being released on august 7th 2020 and the second one being released on december 9th 2020.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EurHP1DCJg">video 1 (august 7)</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjqAQRTsOJU">video 2 (december 9)</a></p>
    
    <p>after doing its own research the only conclusion that nyahrdh can believe is that ttr made all of this up for views and clout. at one point it thought that he might have just been egregiously bad at research, but the amount of incompetence and left out information that would have been required for that to be the case makes that highly unlikely.</p>
    
    <h2>tune in, hook up</h2>
    <p>nyahrdh believes understanding youtube's early history is important for this discussion, so here's an overview.</p>
    <p>youtube's domain name (youtube.com) was activated on february 14, 2005 and opened around april 23rd. originally it was intended to be a dating site that had video functionality. this idea didn't turn out well, so they decided to just open it up to all video. it's unclear when this decision was actually made though, as no sources seem to say. archive.org's first youtube capture (april 28) seems to suggest that it was a dating site by that point, but the few (3 or so) videos that were uploaded by that point don't seem like dating site videos at all. wikipedia says that youtube's uploading functionality was enabled on april 23rd which would make sense, but this claim is not sourced.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050428014715/http://www.youtube.com/">april 28 (first capture and last with 'i'm looking for' text)</a><p>
    <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050429024525/http://www.youtube.com:80/">april 29 (no 'i'm looking for' text)</a></p>
    
    <h2>this guy is such a shit youtuber sorry</h2>
    <p>nyahrdh will now go through both of ttr's videos about this subject, extract the information from them, and show that all of it is fake.</p>
    <p>within the first few seconds there's already inaccuracies: youtube, as nyahrdh has mentioned above, did not actually open until april. ttr makes it sound like youtube went for months with upload functionality but no uploads. this makes no sense, and it would also lead to a strange anomaly. youtube would have had to have been a desert of content for two months, but then within less than 10 days 5 videos are uploaded (including two on the day of the first upload)? ttr also seems to think that jawed is just some random guy, and not one of youtube's co-founders. </p>
    
    <p>we now enter the actual claim.<p>
    
    <p>ttr starts off by explaining his misunderstanding of early youtube. he for some reason dances around saying that it started out as a dating site, calling it an "online site where you can meet people based off of certain parameters that you could check based off your account settings". he also for some reason thinks that very early youtube didn't have channels? nyahrdh doesn't know where that came from.</p>
    
    <p>and then we have our first reddit screenshot. ttr made a massive, pathetic mistake in this department which completely annihalates any chance of this not being a hoax, but nyahrdh will come back to that later.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/5EurHP1DCJg?t=166">the first screenshot</a></h2>
    <p>the reddit post claims that they found evidence of a youtube channel from february 28 2005, which was only 2 weeks after youtube's domain name was activated, by 'viewing earlier versions of the cache on archive.org'. ttr says the opposite of this in his commentary over this for some reason, maybe because he can't keep his lie straight very easily and forgot. whoops!</p>
    <p>then ttr shows a comment thread where somebody says that you can find the page by going to www.youtube.com/s/14 on any web crawler viewer, but there is no evidence of this page ever existing. there are two archive.org captures of the page, both of which are from january 2021 and are 404s. also, he uses the webcrawler *search engine* which is not an archival site.</p>
  
    <p>then he shows a higher quality version of the screenshot and we can see how obviously fake it is.</p>
    
    <p>the first thing that should come to mind is that this is obviously not the april youtube homepage. in fact it is actually the homepage youtube switched to in may/june of that year. the fact that there is metadata along with the video, and that the copyright tagline has an RSS button means that this is from at the earliest june 17. speaking of the metadata, it's even more evidence that this is fake! how would youtube have thousands of views on test videos this early, when the earliest captures of this style of homepage show that all the featured videos have less than 100 views? COULD YOU NOT BE BOTHERED TO EDIT THE VIEW COUNT?</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050623004326/http://www.youtube.com:80/">anyway, here's the screenshot that was used to fake it. the view counts all line up, as do the tags at the center of the screen.</a></p>
    
    <p>there really isn't any need to continue, is there? but nyahrdh will anyway.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/5EurHP1DCJg?t=188">the second screenshot</a></h2>
    <p>this one is ridiculous.</p>
    <p>the most obvious clue that this is fake is the date in the top right corner reading "may 16, 2005." probably should have cropped it out! but looking everything else makes this even worse.</p>
    <p>this is the youtube homepage from, obviously, may 16 2005, with the large empty space below the login box edited (really really badly; its so obvious if you look closely) with a youtube player from 2006. this is supposedly com-test 2, which conveniently isn't in the homepage capture. how did they find the link, then?</p>
    
    <h2>jawed's other videos</h2>
    <p>ttr goes on to explain that jawed uploaded videos other than Me at the zoo. this is true and the screenshot is real, but it's also not new information. it's not well known by any means, but jawed uploaded a lot in youtube's early days, at one point in december 2005 having over 100 videos on his channel. all but one have since been deleted. you could have talked about that instead of making shit up!</p>
    
    <p>ttr finishes by claiming that this was backed up by other people, and conveniently not showing the audience what those people said. funny that.
    
    <p>you might say to nyahrdh that maybe he was misled by reddit screenshots and he's so bad at research he couldn't figure out it was false. nyahrdh would think that, but</p>
    <h1><b>THE REDDIT ACCOUNTS ARE FUCKING FAKE</b></h1>
    <p>all of the reddit accounts shown in screenshots in the video are in some way fake.</p>
